Suggested step-by-step workflow:
✅ Define your classes: User, Flight, Booking
✅ Include attributes and simple constructors.

Create sample data:
✅ Hardcode a few users (agents and customers), flights, and bookings to test.

Write your login function:
✅ Make sure it validates users correctly and distinguishes roles.

Build main menu and role-based menus:
Start with basic printout menus and input handlers, no features yet.

Implement simple features first:
For example, list all flights for customers, list all customers for agents.

Implement Unit Tests:
✅ implement at least 2 of these unit test cases

Add CRUD operations gradually:
Add booking, create flight, add/remove customers, filtering, etc.

Add advanced features:
Loyalty points, automated tags, export to CSV.

Test extensively after each new feature
This way you can catch errors early.
